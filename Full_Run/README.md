*.ipynb Jupyter notebook file, contains python code
*.mmol MagiC topology file (see /Other_Jupyter_Notebooks/Creating_Rdfs.ipynb to see creation)
*.mcm MagiC topology file, generated by rdf.py
*.inp MagiC rdf.py input file
*.rdf MagiC RDF file
*.pot MagiC potential file
*.in LAMMPS input file
*.table LAMMPS potential file
*.xtc LAMMPS trajectory file

/LAMMPS_Inputs
Contains the *.in input files used to run the simulations to generate the training data

/LAMMPS_Potentials
